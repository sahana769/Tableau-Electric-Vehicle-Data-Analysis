## Problem Statement
Organizations and policymakers often lack clear insights into electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends, top-performing vehicle brands, and overall market distribution.  
This limits data-driven decisions for marketing, infrastructure planning, and strategic investments in the EV sector.

## What I Implemented
- Collected and cleaned EV registration data for analysis.
- Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize:
  - EV adoption trends over the years
  - Top 8 vehicle makes by total EV registrations
  - Key metrics and patterns across the EV market
- Generated clear, actionable insights for decision-making.
- Saved visualizations as screenshots for easy sharing and presentation.
